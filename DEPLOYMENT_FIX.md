# Quick Deployment Fix - tensor.homes

## What I Found (The Real Issue)

Your Vercel project is deploying **a completely different codebase**. 

**Evidence:**
- Your local project builds with: `prisma generate && next build` (Next.js)
- Vercel builds with: `vite build` (a Vite app called "tldrawapp") 
- Package names don't match: "tensor.homes" vs "tldrawapp"

**This is why:**
- ‚úÖ Works locally: You're running the correct Next.js project
- ‚ùå Broken on Vercel: It's deploying a different Vite-based project

## Files I Fixed

### ‚úÖ `middleware.ts` - Updated to Clerk v5
- Replaced deprecated `authMiddleware` with `clerkMiddleware`
- Uses proper Clerk v5 patterns
- Protects all routes except public ones

### ‚úÖ `package.json` - Removed Turbopack from Build
- Removed `--turbopack` flag from build script
- Turbopack is experimental and can cause Vercel issues
- Still available for `npm run dev`

## Now Do This:

### 1. Test Locally (2 minutes)
```bash
cd C:\Users\eddie\Desktop\errata\tensor.homes
npm run build
npm start
# Visit http://localhost:3000 - should work fine
```

### 2. Check Your GitHub Connection (5 minutes)
```bash
# See which repo this folder is connected to
git remote -v

# See recent commits
git log --oneline -5

# Make sure this IS the repo connected to Vercel!
```

### 3. Fix Vercel Connection (10 minutes)

**Option A: Nuclear Option (Easiest)**
1. Go to vercel.com ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings
2. Delete the project
3. Create new project ‚Üí Import from GitHub
4. Select the CORRECT repository (the one from `git remote -v`)
5. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js settings
6. Add environment variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
   - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`
7. Deploy!

**Option B: Fix Current Connection**
1. Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Git
2. Check connected repository
3. Make sure it's pointing to `tensor.homes` repo (not some other tldraw project)
4. If wrong, disconnect and reconnect to correct repo

### 4. Commit and Push Your Fixes
```bash
git add middleware.ts package.json
git commit -m "fix: update to Clerk v5 middleware and remove turbopack from build"
git push origin main
```

## Why This Happened

You probably have multiple tldraw projects/experiments:
- One is a Vite-based app (the one Vercel is deploying)
- One is your Next.js app (the one you're working on locally)

Vercel got connected to the wrong one. Classic mistake when experimenting with different setups.

## Expected Result

After fixing the Vercel connection and pushing your code:
- ‚úÖ Vercel will build with Next.js (not Vite)
- ‚úÖ Auth will work with Clerk v5 middleware
- ‚úÖ Prisma will generate correctly
- ‚úÖ Your app will match local behavior

## If It Still Doesn't Work

1. Check Vercel build logs - should say "Building Next.js app" not "vite build"
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Check that DATABASE_URL is accessible from Vercel
4. Make sure the Prisma migration was run on your production database

## Additional Notes

- Your Prisma setup (custom output path) is fine, but if you have issues, consider using default path
- tldraw v4 is properly configured - no issues there
- Your API routes look solid
- The editor implementation follows tldraw best practices

**The ONLY real issue:** Wrong project connected to Vercel. Everything else is solid.

Need help? The fix is literally just:
1. Delete Vercel project
2. Reimport from correct GitHub repo
3. Set env vars
4. Deploy

That's it, G. üöÄ
